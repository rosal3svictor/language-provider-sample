    <h1> Internationalization with react-i18next </h1>
</div>

This repository was created with the intention of providing developers with a
sample of an internationalization provider for a React-TypeScript application
through the usage of the patterns:

- [Hooks](https://www.patterns.dev/posts/hooks-pattern/)
- [Provider](https://www.patterns.dev/posts/provider-pattern/)

### Testing Tools:

1. [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)
2. [Jest DOM](https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom)
3. [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro)

### Documentation Standard

1. [TSDoc](https://tsdoc.org/)

# How to use it

1. Install pnpm globally in your machine. ([See the official docs](https://pnpm.io/installation))
2. Execute `pnpm run ci` to perform the instalation of all dependencies. (Read [this reference](https://betterprogramming.pub/npm-ci-vs-npm-install-which-should-you-use-in-your-node-js-projects-51e07cb71e26) for more details)
3. Execute `pnpm run dev`, and immediately you will see the vite server running.

# Requirements for daily development workflow

The development considered to be a candidate of a new version within the project,
should comply with the following criteria:

1. **Do not commit a new version if the development is not completed**. Each
   commit is expected to be associated to a single ticket number, it means that
   **only one commit is allowed per ticket assigned** (unless you have to perform a
   merge with main, this will be the extra commit allowed only)
2. **Each commit under the repo must deliver a stable version of the app**
3. The commit must state the title of the task/subtask that was taken
4. Add a description providing the answers to the following questions:
   - How the development in the branch will add value to the project?
   - Is there any remaining work to be done? Please, provide the ticket number
     that will cover this development

### _**EXCEPTIONS:**_

_If there's a need to merge something that wasn't initially scoped
(unexpected bug, or behaviour) it can be done but, following criteria:_

- _The commit description should state which was the issue that popped up and
  the temporal fix applied_
- _It has to reference the ticket that is created to cover that bug fixing,
  following scalability standards_

# IMPORTANT:

Make usage of the command `pnpm run commit:changes` in order to make a new commit.

When executed this will prompt you to define:

1. Type of change you're commiting (a list will be shown to you)
2. What is the scope of this change? (You can skip it, it is not necessary)
3. A short, imperative tense description of the change (Refer to step 3 from the previous list)
4. A longer description of the change (Refer to step 4 from the previous list)
5. Notify if there's a breking change
   - if yes, you'll have to provide details
   - if no, you'll be moved to the next step
6. Notify if this commit affect any open issues
   - if yes, you'll have to add the issue references
   - if no, you'll be moved to the next step
7. The commit will be added to the git history
8. You can push the prevously created commit to the remote repository

# FAQ

- What's the difference between the `public` and the `asset` folder?

  If you have assets that need to be bundled in some way so they need to run
  through some loader that will minify or transform them in some way, it makes
  sense to put them in the `assets` folder. On the other hand, if you have static
  assets that don't need any sort of processing you can just put them directly
  in the `public` folder and these are going to be copied into your build.
